 * Interface ContainerInterface
 *
 * Extends the PSR-11 ContainerInterface to provide a consistent, domain-specific container interface
 * for the FastForward ecosystem. This interface SHALL serve as the preferred type hint within FastForward
 * components, while maintaining full compatibility with PSR-11 standards.
 *
 * Implementations of this interface MUST adhere to the behavior defined by PSR-11, specifically:
 *
 * - `get(string $id)` MUST return an entry if available, or throw a `NotFoundExceptionInterface`.
 * - `has(string $id)` MUST return true if the entry can be resolved, false otherwise.
 *
 * This abstraction MAY be extended in the future to incorporate additional container-related functionality
 * specific to the FastForward framework, without violating PSR-11 compatibility.
